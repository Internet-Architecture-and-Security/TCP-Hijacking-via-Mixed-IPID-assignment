## Get Started

- IPID Counter Hash Collision Side Channel
- This is a pure python demo project exploit Linux IPID Hash collision.

### Single Script
In `Single_Script` you can act this TCP side channel attack step-by-step.

### IPID_HCSC
`IPID_HCSC` a well encapsulated python library used for attack. Some usecases can be found in `main.py`.
